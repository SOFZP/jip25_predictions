# Solana Validator Ranking Data (Jito's JIP-25 Model) - August 22, 2025

This dataset presents a ranking of Solana validators inspired by the Jito's [JIP-25 proposition](https://forum.jito.network/t/jip-25-expand-the-validator-set-and-modify-jito-stake-pool-eligibility-and-ranking-criteria/877). The data was generated by a script that aggregates metrics from several on-chain and off-chain sources to provide a holistic view of validator performance and configuration.

✓ Current epoch: 837   
✓ Analyzing epochs: 807 - 837   
✓ Processing 1088 validators

## ► Data Methodology & Sources

The ranking is derived from four key metrics, applied sequentially. Each validator's final position is determined by its performance across these criteria in order of priority.

### Jito-Based Eligibility Criteria (Blockers)

To align more closely with the Jito Network's internal standards, the ranking methodology uses critical flags reported directly by the Jito steward program to determine validator eligibility. This approach replaces previous checks based on age or a fixed commission percentage.

For each validator, the script fetches the latest `InstantUnstakeComponents` event from the Jito API's `steward_events` endpoint. If the data within this event shows `true` for any of the following flags, the validator is marked as **ineligible** and moved to the bottom of the final ranking. The specific reason is noted in the output.

The flags checked are:
-   `is_blacklisted`: The validator is flagged as blacklisted by Jito.
-   `delinquency_check`: The validator has failed a delinquency check, indicating poor uptime or voting performance.
-   `commission_check`: The validator has failed a commission check (e.g., it was set too high).
-   `mev_commission_check`: The validator has failed an MEV commission check (e.g., it was set too high).

This method ensures that the ranking prioritizes validators that are fully compliant with Jito's most important operational standards.

### Ranking Metrics & Data Sources

1.  **Maximum Commission (`max_commission`)**
    -   **Description**: The highest commission rate charged by the validator over the last 30 epochs. Lower is better.
    -   **Primary Source**: Historical `commission_max_observed` data from the **Marinade.Finance API**.
    -   **Fallback Source**: The validator's current commission as reported by the **Solana CLI**.

2.  **Maximum MEV Commission (`max_mev_commission`)**
    -   **Description**: The highest MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) commission charged over the last 30 epochs. Lower is better.
    -   **Primary Source**: Historical `mevCommission` data from the **TheValidators.io History API**.
    -   **Fallback Source**: The validator's current `mev_commission_bps` as reported by the **Jito Geyser API**.

3.  **Validator Age (`validator_age`)**
    -   **Description**: The validator's age measured in epochs. Higher is better.
    -   **Primary Source**: Calculated from the `start_epoch` provided by the **Marinade.Finance API**.
    -   **Fallback Source**: The `first_epoch_distance` metric from the **Stakewiz.com API**.

4.  **Total Credits (`total_credits`)**
    -   **Description**: The sum of all credits earned for voting over the last 30 epochs. Higher is better.
    -   **Primary Source**: Sum of historical `credits` from the **Marinade.Finance API**.
